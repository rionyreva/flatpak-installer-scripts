# flatpak installer scripts

These scripts automatically add the Flathub repositories if they are not already present on the system. This simplifies the installation and management of Flatpak applications.

You can check the contents of the script before executing it by clicking on the script title, such as "flatpak-tools-installer.sh." This will take you directly to the raw file, where you can ensure that there is no harmful or suspicious code in the scripts if you are unsure of their trustworthiness.
